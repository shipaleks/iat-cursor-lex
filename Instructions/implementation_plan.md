### **AI-Friendly Implementation Plan for Lexical Decision Web App**

**1. Setup Environment**

*   Install Node.js v18 and npm for managing packages (from **Tech Stack: Dependencies**).
*   Install Firebase CLI globally to manage all Firebase services.
*   Initialize version control by creating a Git repository in your project directory (as per **PRD: Version Control**).
*   Set up the project structure by creating directories for frontend (`src/`), components, and services in the main directory.

**2. Firebase Configuration**

*   Access the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (described in **Firebase Setup 5.1**).
*   Enable Firestore, Realtime Database, and Firebase Storage within the project settings (mentioned in **PRD Section 4**).
*   Install Firebase SDK in the project directory using `npm install firebase`. Initialize Firebase within the `firebaseConfig.js` file in the `src/services` directory, including credentials from the Firebase Console (outlined in **Firebase Setup 5.2**).

**3. Develop Frontend Components**

*   Choose a frontend framework (React) and initialize the project using `create-react-app` or a custom setup with Webpack (detailed in **Tech Stack: Frontend**).
*   Implement a simple and clean UI based on the provided flow: Create components for login, instructions, trial screen, and session end (as noted in **PRD Section 3** and **App Flow**).
*   Map design from the wireframes directly into React components (using Material-UI for consistent styling).
*   Implement state management (using React Context API) to handle global UI states like participant nickname, session progress, and data logging.

**4. Develop Backend Integration**

*   Implement CSV data upload functionality with a dedicated React component. Use the Firebase Storage to upload images and Firestore to store text data (as needed in **PRD Section 4.1**).
*   Create Firebase functions or hooks within `src/services` to automate CSV uploads, file tracking, and storage referencing.
*   Design CRUD operations for handling session data and real-time updates (based on **PRD Section 6.1**).

**5. Implement Logic for Randomization and Trials**

*   Write a function to shuffle words per image, ensuring a balanced presentation of real vs. non-words.
*   Use a performance API to calculate reaction times precisely as noted under **Reaction Time Calculation**.
*   Store each trial's participant data (like reaction times and responses) in Firestore with real-time updates to ensure data integrity.

**6. Testing and Validation**

*   Write unit tests for components using Jest to ensure functionality around UI interaction and data logging is intact (referenced in **Testing & Validation 12.1**).
*   Conduct integration testing within development environments using Cypress, ensuring that workflows like CSV uploads see consistent performance.
*   Validate the final data by performing test uploads, and downloading CSV to see if all required fields show correctly as per **Data Export 11.1**.

**7. Deployment**

*   Conduct a final check of environment variables and production-specific configurations (ensuring proper Firebase configurations and keys).
*   Perform a local build using `npm run build` and verify the build enters the correct output directory (`build/`), based on **Deployment 13.1**.
*   Use Firebase Hosting for deployment: start by running `firebase init` in your root project directory, select necessary Firebase services including hosting, then run `firebase deploy` (as specified in **Deployment 13.2**).
*   Enable analytics to collect data post-deployment (using Firebase Analytics) to monitor application performance and user behavior.

The plan is designed to ensure a straightforward progression from development through to deployment, utilizing AI-powered tools for accelerated coding and precise debugging. Emphasis is placed on using Firebase for seamless backend integration, with a focus on maintaining a simple, intuitive frontend for experiment participants.
